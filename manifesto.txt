---SITE MANIFESTO---


1. Dynamically changing themes
There will be four (maybe more, maybe less) different stylistic versions of my portfolio, all
created upon the same base foundation. Changes will only really include font changes, bg-image
changes, and maybe occasionally add exclusive effects like sound effects, etc. The themes can
be changed by refreshing the page. Upon refreshing, the next theme will be selected (not random
to ensure all themes can be visited and the same theme is not repeated in a row).

a. Theme 1: BIONICLE
   Theme 2: Halo
   Theme 3: Mountains
   Theme 4: '80s Chevy'
   Theme 5: Minecraft?
   Theme 6: Star Wars


2. Fun, useful tools and games
A blog / journal for me to personally use would be an excellent way to demonstrate back-end +
front-end skills in combination, as well as serve as a useful tool for me to use personally
in my day-to-day life. Fun mini-games can elevate the experience, maybe some version of snake
or a small, easy to create-deploy game with save functionality.
